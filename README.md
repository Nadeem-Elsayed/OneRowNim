This game was inspired by one of my professors for an object oriented programming class

He introduced us to the game of One Row Nim and I was very interested

Then I thought to myself "This game looks very simple, maybe there is a constant way to beat the game"

So I developed this program with a smart AI that will win every winnable position.
